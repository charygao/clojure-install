# clojure-install

The Clojure install project is used to bootstrap a system to include Clojure,
tools.deps.alpha, and the scripts necessary to use them to obtain more 
dependencies and run a Clojure repl or programs.

The installer assumes only that Java is available. The install tool is written
in Java and bundled (in an uberjar) with the necessary Maven Aether libraries to 
traverse and download the initial dependency set.

In general, this project will be obtained and used within system installers rather
than used directly.

## Usage

### `clojure.tools.Install`

The `Install` program performs the following steps:

* Read `~/.clojure/clj.props`
* Use those props to form a dependency set
* Download those dependencies and all transitive dependencies to the local Maven repository
* If `~/.clojure/clj.cp` or `~/.clojure/deps.edn` exist, copy them to backup files
* Create `~/.clojure/clj.cp` - used when invoking tools.deps.alpha
* Create `~/.clojure/deps.edn` - user-level deps map, for declaring default deps and artifact providers

This can be re-run to pick up manual changes in `clj.props`.

### `clj.props` file

Example props file:

```
org.clojure/clojure=1.9.0-alpha17
org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha=0.1.14
org.clojure/spec.alpha=0.1.123
```
